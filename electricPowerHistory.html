    <h2>Brief History of Electric Power</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Thomas Edison's first electric power plant generated 110-volt direct 
        current (DC) for lighting and a variable machinery in a nearby buildings.<br>
        But efficient transmission of power over long distances requires higher voltages.<br>
        In those days,the only way to transform DC volttage was to use
        a "genset"- a Dc motor driving a DC generator.That's two rotating machines,with four windings.

    <p>
        Then Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current (AC) induction
        motor and transformer.With constant AC frequency,an induction motors
        speed cannot vary,but it is cheaper and more durable than a DC geneset.
        so at the dawn of the 20th century,AC won "the war of currents."

        But not forever.In the middle of 20th century,computers began consuming 
        progressively more DC power.Then came the insulated-gate bipolar transformer (IGBT)
        and the voltage-source converter (VSC).A VSC can make variable-frequency AC which runs
        induction motors at variable speed and it easily transform DC

        DC power,computer control, and the internet are helping the power
        grid accept variable renewable resources like wind and solar.And 
        they are improving electrocsl distribution systems on campuses,in neighborhoods and 
        in buildings.With local energy generation and storage,distribution systems are 
        evolving into robust "microgrids."
