    <h1>History of Lawrence Hydropower</h1>
    <p>
        In 1874 Lawrence Kansas residents had burned all the region's wood,and fossil fuels were not available.
        Orlando Darling built a dam across the Kansas River north of town and strong mechanical cables from a water wheel to power
        local industries.Justin Bowerersock bought the operation,naming it &apos;The Bowersock Mills & Power Company&apos;
        <em>(Bowerersock)</em>.Bowersock's slogan is:
        <pre>
                Producing clean,renewable hydropower since 1874
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        "By 1885,twelve water wheels drove flouring mills,a paper mill,two elevators,a twine factory,shirt factory,two machine shops,
        the Leis chemical works printing offices,the barb wire works and a few other minor industries...Rebuilding from the ice damage of 1888...
        Bowerersock introduced four dynamos that turned raw power into electrical energy".<i>History of Bowerersock Power.</i>To supplement the old 2.4MW plant 
        on the south side of the river.Bowersock recently added a new 4.6<abbr>MV</abbr> plant on the north side.
    </p>
    <p>
        To raise funds for the new 4.6<abbr>MV</abbr> plant,Bowerersock signed a 25-year power-purchase agreement with Kansas City'
        Board of Public Utilities(<abbr>BPU</abbr>),saying <strong>Bowerersock must send <abbr>BPU</abbr>(annual average power) &ge; (80% of it's
        total generating capacity)</strong>.Instantenous power is proportional to (water flow rate) &cross; (water height difference).Because 
        the river's flow varies with rainfall,the power delivered also varies.To maximize the deliverable energy,
        Bowerersock employs a <em>run-of-the-river</em> policy.This keeps the upstream water level as high as possible and uses whatever flow
        occurs with the maximum upstream level.
    </p>
    <p>
        Energy is stored in the height of the upstream water.By intentionally varying this height,Bowersock could use the stored energy
        to offset variation in local rate of consumption or renewable power generation.But this might 
        compromize Bowerersock's contract with BPU.Therefore:<mark>Until the BPU contract ends,energy stored in the water
         behind the dam is not available to lawrence.</mark>
